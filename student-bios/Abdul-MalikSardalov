                         My favorite quote
                After hardship, there is always relief.

**3.** ***A little bit about yourself***

**I am 23 years old and I am from Ukraine. At the moment I'm in Belgium and I'm studying to become a ***FRONT-END*** developer.**

Hobbies include:
- Play football with friends ⚽
- Play FIFA 🎮
- I like to read books before going to bed 🕮
- Walk in warm weather and drink coffee 🚶‍♂️☕

> I feel like I'm already a grandfather in my heart.


**4.** **Future plans**
    
***In the near future, I plan to complete the course I am currently studying and start my career in IT as a developer.***

***For me, there are no other global and important goals yet. I also plan to settle down in Belgium and improve my life in this country.***

***I hope everything works out for me!***
