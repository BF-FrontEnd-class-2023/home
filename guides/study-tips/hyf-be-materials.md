# HYF Be Materials

Each module you will create one `check-in` issue using the template in your
class repo. You will use this issue to track your progress through the
_Suggested Study_ resources, the _Sunday Prep_ materials, and individual
_Exercises_. You will write your _Thursday Check-Ins_ in this issue. `check-in`
issues won't be placed on the module project board.

## Module Exercises

> You should try to complete the 🥚's and being the 🐣's

Most modules will have exercises to practice alongside the projects. These
emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as
possible. If you can't master all the material at once, that's expected!
Anything you don't master now will always be waiting for you to review when you
need it:

- 🥚: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- 🐣: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- 🐥: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- 🐔: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with 🥚, 🐣 and 🐥 you can use the 🐔 exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

Alongside each project there will be a set of exercises. Unlike projects the
exercises will focus in on specific skills, tools or concepts. Exercises are
made up of smaller and more repetitive problems to solve, always with tests so
you can move through them with confidence.

Sometimes there will be _a lot_ of exercises, and these exercises can be quite
challenging. You should start each set of exercises to be aware of the skills
you're expected to apply in the projects, but you are not expected to complete
every exercise right away when they are assigned. If you find you want to dive
deeper into one topic, or that you've finished the project early and want to
keep studying, go on and finish all the exercises! Otherwise they'll always be
there for you, you can go back and complete the exercises later in the course or
after you leave HYF. This has been a successful strategy for many students
before you.

Exercises will come in 3 general types as well:

1. **Theory**: Theory exercises will look deeply at the technologies you are
   using. All of these exercises will be accompanied by an execution
   visualization for you to really understand what's happening behind your code.
   You might find these exercises a bit dry, or might love them! Either way
   they're worth every minute you spend studying them. If you don't take the
   time to master the theory exercises you will have a hard time debugging your
   code, applying the technologies correctly, writing & reading tests, or
   effectively using the developer tools.
2. **Practice**: These exercises are what you probably think of as standard
   coding exercises, the types of challenges you find on FreeCodeCamp and other
   web tutorials. Practice exercises will be bite-sized coding challenges that
   ask you apply the technologies you studied in Theory exercises to solve small
   challenges.
3. **Integration**: Integration exercises are effectively tiny projects. In them
   you will practice integrating the various skills and technologies you've
   learned so far into realistic (but tiny) projects. Imagine something like
   building 5 websites with only one button each. It's enough to practice the
   process of building and completing something without getting lost in the size
   of your project.

## Suggested Study

> 100% Optional, these are just suggested resources

Each module will include a list of study links helpful for that module's
learning objectives. If you don't find them helpful or prefer another resource,
no worries! If you find a great resource that you think would help other
students, please share it with a pull request!

You will use the _Suggested Study_ section of your `check-in` issue to keep
track of the resources you've found the most helpful during the module.

## Sunday Prep

> You should be familiar with the lesson material before each lesson

At the top of each chapter's section you will find a list of videos, articles or
examples to study **before** coming into class on Sunday. These resources will
be _organized by topic_. You do not need to deeply study each and every link,
but we do expect you to familiarize yourself with each topic. This might mean
studying one link from each topic in detail and only skimming the rest. It's up
to you to find the method that works best for you.

## Extra Support

<<<<<<< Updated upstream If feel that you need extra support, let us know on
Discord or with your Thursday Check-in. We'll get in touch and together find a
solution to help you move forward. This might include individual support from a
coach, pairing you with a study-buddy, or helping to find study resources that
better fit your needs. ======= If feel that you need extra support, let us know
on Slack or with your Wednesday Check-in. We'll get in touch and together find a
solution to help you move forward. This might include individual support from a
coach, pairing you with a study-buddy, or helping to find study resources that
better fit your needs.
