# Study Tips

Of all the skills you will need as a developer **effective learning** is the
most important. There is no library, no framework, no buzzword you can master
that will serve you better than strong study and learning habits.

Fortunately studying and learning are skills you can improve. Keeping an
organized study journal is the first step. So take some extra time before,
during, and after you write some code to write down some notes on what you just
learned.

As you work through this curriculum we will often recommend ways to take notes
on particular topics (ie. descriptive diagrams, questions to explore, organizing
& deploying your notes), but for now take your notes however you usually do. For
now just be sure to take regular notes and to keep them organized.

Take lots of notes! On post-its, GitHub, or even your arm. If you don't make an
effort to manage your learning process you'll be surprised at how quickly it can
slip away from you.

Pay special attention to:

- **Vocabulary:** In programming words have very specific definitions, it's
  important that you use them precisely. This can be extra tricky since many of
  the key programming vocab words are also non-programming words. It's easy to
  slip back and forth between a word's every-day meaning and it's programming
  definition.
- **Your Challenges:** Take especially good notes on what you find difficult
  even if that just means you write a quick list of things you struggled with
  today. Not only will this help you structure your studying by concentrating on
  your weak points, but it will also help you learn to pin-point what you don't
  understand. This kind of self-awareness is crucial for software developers.
- **What you enjoy:** As you continue to study programming you will get
  discouraged. Having a record of all the things you enjoy about coding will
  help with more than just motivation. It will also help you learn more
  effectively, it's easier to focus on and learn something you enjoy. You can
  think of this list like a back-up study plan. Whenever you're about to walk
  out, pull up this list and build something fun!
- **Stages of development:** While you're building your projects, don't just
  focus on the finished product. Focus on the journey. This might sound corny,
  but the truth is that one of the biggest differences between beginner
  programmers and expert programmers is the way approach & build up projects in
  careful steps. You'll get a chance to learn about this in more detail later
  on, but it's never too late to get started!
