# Module Deliverables

All modules will have a deliverable or two: some are projects and some are
smaller, some are group and some are individual.

- [Deliverable Issues](module-deliverables.md#deliverable-issues)
- [Submission and Feedback](module-deliverables.md#submission-and-feedback)

## Deliverable Issues

Each individual or group (depending on the assignment) will create one issue per
deliverable in your class repo. This issue is used to track your progress on
each assignment. These issues will be posted on the **deliverables** project
board.

There is a template issue your class repository to help you get started, be sure
to copy-paste the deliverable's checklist from the curriculum outline, and to
use labels/milestones and assignees to make your issue findable.

### Blocked?

If you or your team wasn't able to finish the deliverable, please leave a note
in your issue explaining what blocked your team, and how far you were able to
make it. This will help your coaches and classmates know how they can help you.

### What counts as a submission?

1. You have created a new issue with a clear and helpful title.
2. The issue has a checklist with working links
3. All of the links must work! A dead link will count as a missing assignment.
4. Your card needs to be in the "READY FOR REVIEW" or "NEEDS REVISION" column.
5. If it is a project, your repository must have a completed **Retrospective**
   file in `/planning`
6. Your project does not need to be finished to be reviewed! If you did not
   finish the project you may still move your issue to "READY FOR REVIEW" if:
   - it has the `help-wanted` label
   - you have explained what was blocking you in the comments
   - you have written a good Retrospective

If your coach has some suggestions to improve your assignment, they will move
your card to "NEEDS REVISION". This still counts as an on-time homework
submission! You or your group can address the feedback in the coming week.

If the assignment is finished and the coach has no further comments, they will
close your issue and move it to the "DONE" column.

### Submission and Feedback

We use GitHub
[Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues),
[Project Boards](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-github-deliverable-boards-2944e6ffbf3c)
and
[Notifications](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications)
to submit assignments and give feedback. You will find a
[template issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
you can use to start each week's submission.

This submission workflow is very similar to a professional collaboration
workflow. You will be able to use GitHub's project management tools to receive &
implement feedback, and everything will be centralized in your class repo.

The weekly workflow for project submission and feedback will look something like
this:

1. Attend class (on time!). In class you will work in small groups to study some
   examples and exercises.
2. At the beginning of each chapter create a new issue in your class repo for
   the module's deliverables.
3. Study away! Move your card to the "IN PROGRESS" column once you have begun a
   deliverable.
4. You will keep your coaches and classmates up to date on your group's progress
   and challenges by checking off the boxes in your issue and moving your card
   along the project board.
   - **TODO**: Place your issue here before starting to work. Not much going on
     here!
   - **DOING**: Keep your card here when you are happily working away. Using the
     check-boxes in your issue you can keep track of your progress.
   - **BLOCKED**: If you are blocked or confused, add the `help-wanted` label
     and describe what you are stuck on. Please include a comment about what you
     are blocked on and links to the problem in your project repo what has you
     blocked. When you are no longer blocked, please remove the `help-wanted`
     label.
   - **READY FOR REVIEW**: When your team homework has closed all issues & PR's,
     move your card into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column.
5. A coach or alumni will look over your work
   - **NEEDS REVISION**: If there is anything to improve they will leave their
     feedback for you directly on GitHub, either in your weekly issue or as
     aPR/issue in your repository. After you have addressed all of the feedback,
     please move your card back into the _READY FOR REVIEW_ column so we know to
     take another look.
   - **DONE**: When the project is done you've addressed all feedback, _DONE_!
     _(Only coaches can move cards into the "DONE" column!)_
