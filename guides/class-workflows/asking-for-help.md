# Asking for Help

There are a few ways you can reach out for help at HYF:

## On GitHub

Software developers have found many great ways to collaborate on shared code
bases. These workflows are different from what you've probably used before, but
are super helpful once you get used to them. We encourage you to ask and answer
as many code-related questions as possible directly on GitHub so you can get
used to the these workflows _before_ reaching the final project. The three main
ways for you to discuss code on GitHub will be:

### Help Wanted Discussions

When you are blocked on an assignment you can create a new issue using the
`help-wanted` template, or just the `help-wanted` label to your project/check-in
issue. Please include screen shots of your debugger,
[link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet),
and a list of things you've already tried.

### Q & A Discussions

If there is something you would like to review or something you would like to
know more about, just ask! It does not need to be a question about any specific
assignment or even about code. The more the merrier : )

### Deliverables Board

If you are blocked on a deliverable you can add the `help-wanted` label to your
issue, this way your classmates and coaches can filter the project board to find
your blocked assignment.

## On Discord

GitHub is great for deeper discussions around the weekly assignments, but not
everything in life is work! Hop on over to Discord if you would like to schedule
a study call, have questions about what you should be working on, would just
like a quick tip, or are just looking to chat about how much you love coding :)

Please use your main class channel as much as possible, and reply in threads to
keep the main discussion feed easier to follow.
