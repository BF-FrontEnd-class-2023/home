# Check-Ins

You will be required to create a `check-in` issue for each module. These
check-ins are how you will share your individual progress with your classmates.
Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can help you.
Coaches will also use your Thursday Check-Ins to prepare for review calls and
Sunday Class.

## Module Check-in Issue Checklist

Your issue should have a title such as `Elias: Agile Development, 4 weeks` and
make sure you go through these steps:

```markdown
[ ] add yourself as assignee to it. [ ] add the labels check-in & week-x.  
[ ] add the appropriate milestone (eg. 2. Agile Development) [ ] add your
comment using the template on every Thursday
```

## Issue Description

In the main issue description you will copy-paste the module's learning
objective checklist, and possibly a personal study plan. This will help you
track your progress through the module and prioritize your study time.

## Weekly Check-In

Every Thursday you will add a comment to your check-in issue summarizing your
progress over the last week. You will need to write these sections in your
comment using the given template:

- **I Need Help with**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of
  the homework are you struggling to complete?
- **What went well?**: What has been successful so far? have you learned and/or
  completed so far this week?
- **What went less well?**: What mistakes did you and/or your group make? What
  was difficult?
- **Lessons Learned**: What did you learn this week that you will take with you
  into next week? I can be technical, a mindset, a study habit, anything!

When you have posted your Thursday Check-in comment please add the `week-x`
label to your issue, so we know it's ready for review.

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it
`checked-x`.
