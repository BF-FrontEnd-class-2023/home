# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a
lecture**.

You are expected to **study the assigned prep work** _**before**_ **arriving**.
Prep work will cover the theory you need in order to dive into the exercises on
Sunday. Most of your time on Sundays will be in small groups working on a set of
exercises with the support of a coach. **HYF is a majority self-study course.**
Your coach will be there to help out but they will not explain everything or
solve the exercises for you.

_You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday._ In Sunday Classes you
will cover just enough of the week's trickiest concepts to get you ready for the
rest of the week.

So come prepared each Sunday to practice the new material together. After all,
working in groups is hardest things to practice alone over the week ;)

## A Standard Sunday

Every Sunday will be a little different depending on the week's material, but
they will all be similar to this:

0. **Roll Call - Before Class**
   - Your coaches will create a `roll-call` issue, and they will close the issue
     when class begins. Leaving your comment after the issue is closed will
     count as coming late (unless you let us know before Sunday).
1. **Review** (_all together_)
   - Your coaches will spend some time answering questions from last week and
     going over any exercises your class had trouble with. They will start by
     going through the **Q & A** and **Help Wanted** discussions. But also ask
     new questions in person! This is your chance to clear up anything you would
     like to review before moving on to the new material.
2. **New Material** (_all together_)
   - Your coaches will give a short introduction to this Sunday's new material.
     They will help you understand _why_ the new material is important and _how_
     you will use it in the coming week. Because you are expected to have
     studied the prep work and theory before Sunday, the coaches will spend this
     time exploring practical examples instead of explaining the basics.
3. **Examples and Exercises** (_small groups_)
   - In small (usually random) groups you will study this Sundays' examples and
     exercises. Your coaches will go around helping out in the small groups as
     necessary.
4. **Check-In** (_all together_)
   - Each group shares a quick summary of what went well, what went less well,
     and what they learned.
5. **Break!**: üöΩ, ‚òï, üçú, üë•.
6. **Review & New Material** (_all together_)
   - Your coaches will do a quick review of the examples and exercises that were
     most challenging for the class. They will also introduce any new topics
     from the after-break examples and exercises.
7. **Examples and Exercises** (_small groups_)
   - Return to your small groups to continue studying the assigned examples and
     exercises.
8. **Check-In** (_all together_)
   - Each group shares a quick summary of what went well, what went less well,
     and what they learned.
9. **Good Bye** (_all together_)
   - Take a look through the coming week's study plan, then you're all done for
     the day!
