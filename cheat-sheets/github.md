# GitHub Cheat Sheet

GitHub comes with built-in features for collaborating on projects and tracking
progress. You will learn how to use most of these features and workflows through
the homework submission process. Taking the time to understand how we handle
homework at HYF will directly prepare you for working on a team using the _agile
development_ methodology.

## Issues

The cornerstone of the homework submission process is GitHub Issues
\([link 1](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues),
[link 2](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)\). You can think of an
issue as a high-tech post-it note.

## Task Lists

By using check boxes \(`- [ ]`\) you can turn your issues into a
[task list](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists).
This will let you and your coaches see how far you are through the week's
assignments just by displaying a progress bar, without needing to open the
issue.

## Labels, Milestones, Assignees

Over your time at HYF, you and your classmates will create hundreds of issues in
the class repository. To keep everything
[well-organized and searchable](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/filtering-issues-and-pull-requests)
you are required to use
[labels](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/labeling-issues-and-pull-requests),
[milestones](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-milestones),
and
[assignees](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users).

## Notifications

[GitHub Notifications](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications)
will be your best friend. Keep an eye on them to know when a classmate is asking
for help, when someone has answered your question, when your homework has been
reviewed, and much more!

## Mentions

If you want to ask for help from, or share a tip with a specific person you can
[mention them in your issue](https://github.blog/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/)
by writing `@userName`. They'll get a notification on their GitHub account and
will know to come read your issue.

## Project Boards

To help you, your classmates, and your coaches support each other through each
module you will be using
[GitHub Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-project-boards).

Feeling stuck? Move your issue into the _BLOCKED_ column so everyone knows you
have a question!

Want to see just your issues? Or just the project-1 issues? You can
[filter cards in a project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/filtering-cards-on-a-project-board)
based on their _labels_, _milestones_, _assignees_ and more.

## Pull Requests

Coaches will often give you feedback on your assignments by sending
[a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
directly to your assignment repository. This is a standard part of the
[code review workflow](https://github.com/features/code-review/), after some
practice you'll find this is a very practical way to collaborate on a shared
code base.
